# Pomodoro Timer
Pomodoro Timer is a web-based timer application that helps users implement the Pomodoro technique for time management. 
The Pomodoro technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals,
traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.


# Features

• Customizable timer intervals for work and break sessions

• Audible and visual notifications when sessions end

• Ability to pause and resume the timer

• Option to reset the timer to start a new session

• Progress bar indicating the remaining time in the session

• Session history tracking to keep track of completed sessions

# Usage

To use Pomodoro Timer, simply navigate to the project's website and start the timer by clicking on the "Start" button. By default, the timer is set to 25 minutes for work sessions and 5 minutes for break sessions. To customize the timer intervals, click on the "Settings" button and adjust the values.

Once the timer starts, a progress bar will appear to indicate the remaining time in the session. When the session ends, an audible and visual notification will be triggered, and the next session will automatically begin. Users can pause and resume the timer, and reset the timer to start a new session at any time.

Session history is tracked in the "Session History" tab, which displays the start and end times of each completed session.
